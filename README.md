This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

1.       How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding
 test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
 
 I spent like 2 days (12 hours) to complete this.If i get more time , i will include pagination and refine as well as bootstrap grid and animation to it.

2.       What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your chosen language? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.
API data stored in redux and styling is done using SASS.
3.       How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
By debugging and by looking into log files carefully.

4.       How would you improve the API that you just used?
It should refine data according to best time to visit like mornings, evenings , romantic or family.
